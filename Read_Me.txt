Certainly! Let's jump straight to the core calculations and solutions for the utility maximization problem and Nash equilibrium analysis, focusing purely on the formulas and results:

### Part (a): Consumer i's Optimization Problem

Each consumer \( i \) (Anna \( A \) and Lihle \( L \)) aims to solve:
\[ \max_{x_i \in [0, 1]} \left( \ln(a + x_A + x_L) - x_i \right) \]

### Part (b): Nash Equilibria

**Assume Symmetry:**
\[ x_A = x_L = x \]
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{a + 2x} - 1 = 0 \]
\[ a + 2x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1 - a}{2} \]

**Equilibrium Outputs:** \( x_A = x_L = \frac{1 - a}{2} \) given \( a \in (2 - 2\ln(2), 1) \) and assuming \( \frac{1 - a}{2} \) falls within [0,1].

### Part (c): Pareto Efficiency of Nash Equilibrium

**Planner’s Problem:** Maximize total utility, assuming \( x_A = x_L = x \) for simplicity.
\[ \max_{x} 2\ln(a + 2x) - 2x \]
Derivative:
\[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (2\ln(a + 2x) - 2x) = \frac{2}{a + 2x} \cdot 2 - 2 = 0 \]
\[ \frac{4}{a + 2x} = 2 \]
\[ a + 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = \frac{2 - a}{2} \]

**Comparing with Nash Equilibrium:**
- **Nash Equilibrium:** \( x = \frac{1 - a}{2} \)
- **Planner’s Optimal:** \( x = \frac{2 - a}{2} \)

The planner's optimal contribution is higher, indicating that the Nash equilibrium under-provides the public good compared to the Pareto optimal scenario, confirming that the Nash equilibrium is not Pareto efficient.

These are the direct calculations and results for the given game theory problem without the additional narrative.
